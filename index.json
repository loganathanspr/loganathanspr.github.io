More detailed documentation is available at http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~ramasamy/tamiltb/0.1/   Tamil Dependency Treebank version 0.1 (TamilTB.v0.1) is an attempt to develop a syntactically annotated corpora for Tamil. TamilTB.v0.1 contains 600 sentences enriched with manual annotation of morphology and dependency syntax in the style of Prague Dependency Treebank. TamilTB.v0.1 has been created at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Charles University in Prague.\nTreebank is an important resource in building parsers and analyzing the language. As far as our knowledge is concerned, this is the first attempt to build a treebank for Tamil language. Tamil belongs to Dravidian family of languages and mainly spoken in Southern part of India. Main features of the Tamil language include Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order, morphologically rich and agglutination.\nThe main objectives of this project include,\n Annotate data at word level and syntactic level In each level of annotation, trying for maximum level of linguistic representation Building large annotated corpora using automatic annotation process.  The data used for the TamilTB annotation comes from the news domain. We decided to use the news data for two reasons: (i) huge amount of data is available in digital format and can be easily downloadable and (ii) the news data can be considered as representative of written Tamil. At present, the data for the annotation comes from www.dinamani.com , and we downloaded pages randomly covering various news topics. The table below summarises the data used for annotation.\n   No Description Value     1 Source www.dinamani.com   2 Source transliterated Yes   3 Number of Words 9581   4 Number of Sentences 600   5 Morphological Layer Annotation (sen) 600   6 Syntactic Annotation (sen) 600   7 Tectogrammatical Layer Annotation -    Download TamilTB.v0.1 The single package containing the data and the documentation can be downloaded from the following link,\nhttp://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~ramasamy/tamiltb/0.1/TamilTB.v0.1.tar.gz\nThe package can be uncompressed using the following command,\n[shell]$ tar -zxvf TamilTB.v0.1.tar.gz  Contents of TamilTB.v0.1.tar.gz - TamilTB.v0.1/ (top level directory) - data/ TamilTB.v0.1.tmt (in TMT format) TamilTB.v0.1.conll (in CoNLL format, transliterated) TamilTB.v0.1.utf8.conll (in CoNLL format, UTF8) TamilTB.v0.1.tt (only POS tagged corpora in TnT style, transliterated) TamilTB.v0.1.utf8.tt (only POS tagged corpora in TnT style, UTF8) - doc/ index.html (main page) ... ... ... - README.txt  Prerequisites The annotated data in TMT format requires TrEd to be installed.
